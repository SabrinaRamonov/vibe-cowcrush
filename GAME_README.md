### Key Components

#### GameBoard.tsx
- Handles all game logic and user interactions
- Manages swap mechanics and validation
- Processes matches and cascading effects
- Controls animation sequencing

#### CowCell.tsx
- Renders individual cows with colorful backgrounds
- Handles selection state with scale animations
- Implements spring physics for smooth feel
- Manages opacity for match animations

#### UFOAbduction.tsx
- Epic UFO appearance animation
- Glowing beam effect that shoots down
- Synchronized with match detection
- Haptic feedback on abduction

#### gameStore.ts
- Centralized state management with Zustand
- Board generation algorithm (prevents initial matches)
- Score, moves, and game over state
- Reset functionality

#### gameLogic.ts
- **Match Detection**: Scans horizontal and vertical lines
- **Gravity System**: Makes cows fall to fill gaps
- **Valid Move Detection**: Checks if game over
- **Board Refill**: Generates new random cows

## 🎨 Design Details

### Color Palette
- **Background**: Deep space navy (#0a0e27)
- **Board**: Dark blue (#162447)

### Mobile Testing
1. Install Expo Go app on your device
2. Scan the QR code from the terminal
3. Test on actual hardware for haptics and performance

### What to Test
- [x] Cow selection (white border appears)
- [x] Swap mechanics (adjacent swaps work, non-adjacent changes selection)
- [x] Match detection (3+ cows in a row/column)
- [x] UFO animation (appears on match, beam shoots down)
- [x] Score updates correctly
- [x] Moves counter increments
- [x] Gravity (cows fall after match)
- [x] Board refill (new cows appear at top)
- [x] Cascading matches
- [x] Game over detection
- [x] Best score persistence
- [x] New game resets properly
- [x] Haptic feedback

## 🎉 What Makes This Game Special
